# Visual-Wake-Word-Security-Camera
To expand the AI-Powered "Visual Wake Word" Security Camera project, I've added more code files for enhanced functionality. These include a configuration script for easy settings management, an alert system for notifications (e.g., email on detection), a viewer script to browse saved detections, and a requirements.txt file for dependencies.
